# Java-Sets
<h1> Sets in Java </h1>
<p>A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element. As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.</p>
<h4>Union Set</h4>
<p>The union of two sets is a set containing all elements that are in A or in B (possibly both). For example, {1,2}∪{2,3}={1,2,3}.</p>
<h4>Intersection Set</h4>
<p>In mathematics, the intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set containing all elements of A that also belong to B.</p>
<h4>Symmetric Difference</h4>
<p>The symmetric difference of set A with respect to set B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A and B, but not in their intersection. This is denoted as A△B or A⊖B</p>
